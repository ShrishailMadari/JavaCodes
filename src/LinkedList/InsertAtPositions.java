    /*To insert a node at any position in a linked list, follow these steps:

### 1. **Create the New Node:**
   - Allocate memory for the new node.
   - Assign the data to the new node.
   - Set the `next` pointer of the new node to `null` initially.

### 2. **Check for Insertion at the Head (Position 0):**
   - If the position is `0` (inserting at the front), set the `next`
        pointer of the new node to the current head.
   - Update the head to point to the new node, as the new node becomes the first node in the list.

### 3. **Traverse to the Desired Position (For Non-Head Insertion):**
   - Start from the head and use a loop to traverse the list.
   - Stop at the node just before the position where the new node is to be inserted.
   - Ensure you handle cases where the position is out of bounds (greater than the number of nodes in the list).

### 4. **Insert the New Node:**
   - Adjust the `next` pointer of the new node to point to the node that comes after the current
            node at the desired position.
   - Update the `next` pointer of the current node (the node just before the insertion point)
            to point to the new node.

### 5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Empty List:** If the list is empty (head is `null`), simply make the new node the head of the list.
   - **Out of Bounds:** If the position is greater than the length of the list,
        handle it by either inserting at the end or rejecting the insertion with an error message.
   - **Single Element List:** Handle insertion in a list with only one element by
        properly setting the new nodeâ€™s pointers.

### 6. **Update Head (if Necessary):**
   - If the node was inserted at the head, update the `head` reference to point to the new node.
   - If the node was inserted elsewhere, the head remains unchanged.

### 7. **Complexity:**
   - **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes before the
        insertion point because you need to traverse the list.
   - **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(1)` since you are only allocating
        space for the new node.

These are the general steps for inserting a node at any position in a linked list.
