  <h1>
    The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is one of the SOLID <br>
    principles of object-oriented design.<br>
    It states that objects of a superclass should be br
    replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting <br>
    the correctness of the program. In simpler terms, <br>
    if S is a subclass of T, then we should be able to <br>
    replace T with S without altering any of the desirable <br>
    properties of the program (correctness, task performed, etc.).

    This design adheres to the Liskov Substitution Principle, <br>
    ensuring that subclasses can be substituted for their base <br>
    classes without leading to unexpected behavior.
  </h1>
  <h1>
    In summary, the Liskov Substitution Principle ensures that <br>
    when a subclass is used in place of its superclass, the behavior <br>
    of the program remains consistent and predictable. If you find <br>
    that substituting a subclass leads to errors or unexpected results, <br>
    it means the principle is being violated, and you may need to <br>
    reconsider your design.
