  The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is the last
  <br> of the SOLID principles in object-oriented design. DIP states that:

  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.<br>
  Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes).
  Abstractions should not depend on details.<br>
  Details (implementations) should depend on abstractions.
  This principle promotes loose coupling and increases flexibility <br>
  by relying on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
