In this example:

Worker is a "fat" interface because it includes both work() and eat() methods.
The RobotWorker class doesn’t need the eat() method since robots don’t eat.
Implementing an unnecessary eat() method in RobotWorker violates
 ISP because RobotWorker is forced to depend on a method it doesn’t need.
