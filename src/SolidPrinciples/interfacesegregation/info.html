            The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states that <br>
            no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. <br>
            This principle is part of the SOLID principles in object-oriented <br>
            design and helps create interfaces that are specific to the <br>
            needs of different clients, avoiding "fat" or overly broad interfaces.
