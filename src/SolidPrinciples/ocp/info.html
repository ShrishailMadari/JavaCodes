    <h1>
      The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) is one of the SOLID principles, <br>
      stating that software entities (like classes, modules, functions) <br>
      should be open for extension but closed for modification.<br>
      This means you should be able to add new functionality <br>
      without changing existing code, which reduces the risk of introducing <br>
      bugs in tested code and makes maintenance easier.
