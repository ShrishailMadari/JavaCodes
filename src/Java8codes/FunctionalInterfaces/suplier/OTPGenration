The expression `Math.random() * 10` works by leveraging the
`Math.random()` method, which generates a random decimal
number between `0.0` (inclusive) and `1.0` (exclusive).
Here’s a breakdown of how it produces a random number
between 0 and 9:

1. **`Math.random()`**: This method returns a random double
 value in the range `[0.0, 1.0)`. For example, it might
 return values like `0.123`, `0.876`, or `0.543`.

2. **Multiply by 10**: When we multiply the result of `Math.random()`
 by `10`, it scales the number to a new range: `[0.0, 10.0)`.
  Here’s how some example values would look after scaling:
   - `0.123 * 10 = 1.23`
   - `0.876 * 10 = 8.76`
   - `0.543 * 10 = 5.43`

3. **Casting to `int`**: By casting the result to an `int`,
 we discard the decimal part, effectively "rounding down" to
 the nearest whole number. This gives a random integer between
 `0` and `9`. Here’s how the values from the examples above would
 look after casting:
   - `(int) 1.23 = 1`
   - `(int) 8.76 = 8`
   - `(int) 5.43 = 5`

### Why It Generates Between 0 and 9
Since `Math.random()` never actually reaches `1.0` (it’s exclusive),
 `Math.random() * 10` will never quite reach `10`.
 The highest possible value just below `10`, when cast to `int`,
  will be `9`. Thus, the range is `[0, 9]`.

This is why `int randomNumber = (int) (Math.random() * 10);`
generates a random integer in the range 0 to 9.
