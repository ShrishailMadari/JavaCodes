In Javaâ€™s Stream API, there are numerous methods available,
classified into intermediate operations (transformations) and
terminal operations (actions). Each method serves a specific
purpose for processing collections and other data sources in
a functional style.

1. Intermediate Operations
These methods transform a stream into another stream and are "lazy,"
meaning they do not process until a terminal operation is called.
